# HCI
The university is considered one of the most important stages of study in human life, so the university student spends half his day there, so he must arrange his studies thoroughly so as not to lose his passion. The University harnesses all its possibilities to provide a good educational environment for its students and one of the most important services is the service "add and delete", which may be an electronic service and also manual by the academic supervisor. During the period of deletion and addition, a group of students were observed asking some girls where they were sharing, and it seemed that these girls had a desperate need to meet the supervisor, and they also seemed worried and scared, and they repeated their going and returning to the same place to no avail, and the question was repeated to other girls.
